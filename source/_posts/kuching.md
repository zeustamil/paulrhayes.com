From our [trip to Kuching, Borneo](http://www.sam-and-paul.com/2014/05/kuching-borneo/).

> Our final night in Kuching was also a Friday, and the city had a pleasant weekend vibe; market stalls were setup along the riverside, couples and families were out for an evening walk, and bands played to passers by. We took nighttime photos, bought more layer cake and said our farewells to the city.
